== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use this plugin without a MemberFindMe account? =

This plugin is an interface to the MemberFindMe platform, so a MemberFindMe account is required. Please visit [MemberFindMe](http://memberfind.me/) to sign up.

= How does MemberFindMe work? =

MemberFindMe is designed from the ground up to integrate with any website, it works alot like Google Maps, allowing your membership forms and event calendar to work seamlessly on your website. So you use your own WordPress server to publish your web content and layout, but have MemberFindMe perform the heavy lifting of managing memberships and events, storing your sensitive membership and event data with our high availability, triple redundant, secure and PCI compliant data servers. Your membership and event data is safe even if your WordPress server creashes or if it is hacked, and you can continue to access that data without WordPress.

= How does MemberFindMe SEO work? =

Unlike iframe widgets or redirects to sub-domains, our next generation SEO system allows the plugin to deliver dynamic web content to search engines using the Ajax crawling scheme, so all directory and event pages are attributed to your domain.

Every directory profile and event page is delivered with Rich Snippets (structured data, microdata, schema.org), which provides detailed information to search engines to better help your pages get found.
